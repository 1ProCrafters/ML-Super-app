# Pure Python Machine Learning Models

This project is where I will try to create the pure python code for making machine learning models without using any external libraries and using only any files I make or any python libraries that I make. I plan to eventually make an addon to the super app about creating custom pre-existing models and also custom new idea of models.

## Models

### LLMs (Large Language Models)

LLMs are a type of neural network that are designed to be used for natural language processing tasks. They are typically trained on large datasets of text and are capable of generating text that is similar in style and structure to the training data.

[Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model)

### Neural Networks

Neural networks are a type of machine learning model that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information.

### Other Models

## Resources

I will use the following resources to make these models:

- Math behind the models
- Theory of making the models
- Online tutorials and courses
- Books and research papers
- Open source code from other libraries and projects

## Progress

I will keep track of my progress here and add more models as I finish them.
